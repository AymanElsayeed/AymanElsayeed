## Hi, I'm Ayman 👋

I'm a Software Engineer and AI Researcher working at the intersection of privacy, fairness, and production AI systems.

I design systems that are not only functional — but measurable, secure, and robust against adversarial inference.

---

## 🔬 Research Focus

- Bias-aware semantic anonymization
- Adversarial inference on LLMs
- Fairness metrics (demographic parity, equal opportunity, predictive parity)
- Formal privacy guarantees in domain-specific text
- Medical NLP & high-stakes AI evaluation systems

---

## 🏗 What I Build in Practice

- Production-grade backend APIs (FastAPI / Flask)
- Microservice architectures (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD)
- Fairness & bias evaluation pipelines in Python
- AI-driven simulation systems (exam training / decision systems)
- Secure ML deployment workflows

---

## 🎓 Academic Role

**Head of Software Engineering Program**

I teach:

- Computer Architecture (8086 Assembly)
- Networks & Information Security
- Algorithms using Python

I enjoy bridging theoretical foundations with real-world system design.

---

## 🧠 Current Direction

I'm developing a research track around:

**Bias-Aware Semantic Anonymization**  
Studying the relationship between bias and privacy leakage in LLM-based systems, and designing mitigation strategies with measurable guarantees.

---

## 📫 Collaboration

Interested in collaborating on:

- Privacy-preserving NLP
- Fairness in AI systems
- Medical AI training platforms
- Secure AI infrastructure
